### üöÄ About Me

I am a results-driven Python Programmer and Data Scientist with a proven track record in developing robust automation tools and implementing machine learning solutions. My expertise lies in transforming complex data into actionable insights and optimizing operational workflows through innovative technical approaches.

Currently, I'm enhancing search engine optimization (SEO) and website performance monitoring through Python-based automation at a US-based company[cite: 1]. My work includes building keyword ranking trackers [cite: 2], PageSpeed Insights bots [cite: 3], and schema markup validation systems. I also apply data analytics to interpret core web vitals and user behavior, generating actionable reports.
